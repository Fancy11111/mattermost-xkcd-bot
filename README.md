# xkcd-mattermost-bot

This is a small mattermost bot that loads XKCDs.

It supports two commands:
- `<prefix> daily`: Posts the daily XKCD post
- `<prefix> <post-id>`: Posts the XKCD post with this id

## **Warning!**
This bot is not production ready. 

This is small side project for me to learn more about go, viper, cobra and mattermost bots

My code probably contains many antipatterns or worst practices.
